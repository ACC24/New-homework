# Workout-Tracker

This application is a workout tracker created with a Mongo database and a Mongoose schema. On the initial page, the user can add a new workout and choose between resistance and cardio. Once the user inputs the workout info (name, weight, sets, rep, miles, duration) a new workout is created. The user then has the option of either entering a new workout or complete the previous one. On the stats page, the user is presented with a series of graphs showing data from the seven latest workout sessions.
